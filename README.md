# TeamSnap Mega Tournament!

The TeamSnap mega tournament is the biggest tournament of the year. The TeamSnap Mega Tournment repo (this repo) runs the entire tournament. Or, it would if it fully worked!

We need your help to save the tournament!

How to help:
 - Backend [Go here!](https://github.com/teamsnap/teamsnap-mega-tournament/blob/main/backend/README.md)
 - Frontend [Go here!](https://github.com/teamsnap/teamsnap-mega-tournament/blob/main/frontend/README.md)
 - Full Stack: Do both (but you'll probably want to start with the backend)

# M1 & M2 ARM64 Macbook Dockerfile
 - Substitute `./backend/Dockerfile` with `./backend/Dockerfile.arm64` before following the [Backend README.md](https://github.com/teamsnap/teamsnap-mega-tournament/blob/main/backend/README.md)
